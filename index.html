    <p><font color="White"><p>&#8669;<a href ="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Giyu_Tomioka">Giyu</a> is a fairly tall young man of a lean muscular stature and pale complexion, who is almost always seen wearing a serious and emotionless expression. He has unruly black hair of uneven lengths that sticks up in tufts around his head, which he wears tied back in a low messy ponytail at the base of his neck. His bangs fall over his eyes in an uneven fringe. His eyes are sharp and moderately large, their irises a deep sapphire that fades to a lighter blue and their pupils a bluish-black, and are framed by thin eyebrows.</p></font>

    <p><p>&#8669;<a href ="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma?so=search">Zenitsu</a> is a young man of average height with fair skin and downward-sloped, worried-looking eyes that fade from soft brown to gold and golden, forked eyebrows that sharply fade into a warm orange color. He has short, yellow hair of varying lengths, cutting off squarely at the ends where it fades to a darker orange color, that falls in front of his face in uneven bangs, loosely resembling a bowl cut. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's hair was originally black, but it turned the color it is currently when he was struck by lightning during his training.</p></font></p></p></font></li></p></font></li>
